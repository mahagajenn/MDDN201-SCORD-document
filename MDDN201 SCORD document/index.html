											<h2>IDEA</h2>

										<p>Scord is a browser extension which essentially records the screen of your internet browser. As users interact with internet pages, Scord then translate the activities into an in-depth scan and tracks your internet usage. Accessible for users to learn and see their online activity, Scord informs users how the issue of data and internet privacy affects people.</p>

									<h2>IDEATION</h2>
								</header>
										<p>For Assignment Two I have chosen to make a website prototype that shows how SCORD will function as an active website. Using softwares such as Adobe Xd and Nicepage, I will begin to make wireframes to get an idea of what the layout of my website will look like.</p>
									
				<!-- Second Section -->
						<section id="second" class="main">
								<header class="major">
								<h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
								</header>
										<p>From Assignment One I designed a sitemap of the overall website. However, I made additional tweaks here and there and ended up something very different to my initial idea. I wanted to include further information about viruses in the website.</p>
										<P>Moving onto the prototyping, I used Adobe Xd to design wireframes. I made a page of people having the option for people to login. However, I found this feature useless as I don't think people would login to this specific website im designing.
										</P>
										<P>Essentially there are two pages to the website, one having the information section about viruses all on the home page. And the Scan page is a page what a virus may look like before the attack happens.

								<h2>FINAL</h2>
								</header>
								<p>With my finished prototype, I have found using Nicepage a really helpful software to do my website design as it helped me alot with some of my coding weaknesses. Reflecting on this project, the Scan page is an effective way of showing how SCORD can identify when a virus is going to attack. What I enjoyed about this project is that this really helped me think outside the box and push me out of my comort zone as I feel I am not a confident coder. Overall, I really enjoyed this project.</p>
